 <b>Objective</b>: To obtain data of prevalence of risk of the disorder attention deficit (ADHD) in the child and adolescent population of the 
 Canary Islands.</p>
  <p align="justify">  
 <br>
<b>Subjects and method</b>: The sample used is 4858 participants of whom 2553 are girls (52.55%) and 2305 boys (47.45%) with a range of age between 6 
and 16 years. Also of the total sample 2500 participants belong to primary while 2358 come from. These samples detected those participants 
exceeding the cut-off points in the EDAH scale versions validated for the Canary Islands.</p>
 <p align="justify">  
 <br>
<b>Results and conclusions</b>: Analysis of the data gives us a global risk of 11.52% prevalence, which is why one of every seven school children 
could manifest this disorder. We explore the possible differences by sex and age, both in primary and secondary.</p>
