              As a multidisciplinary researcher, my focus lies in identifying and prioritizing risk assessments of environmental chemicals. My passion for this field stems from the pressing need to evaluate the impact of chemicals on human health and the environment. With expertise in multiple disciplines, including toxicology, environmental science, and bioinformatics, I strive to develop a comprehensive understanding of the potential risks associated with chemical exposures.
