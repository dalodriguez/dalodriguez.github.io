 <b>Summary.</b> The average age for pubertal onset in girls has declined over recent decades. Epidemiological studies in humans and experimental 
 studies in animals suggest a causal role for endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that are present in our environment. Of concern, current 
 testing and screening regimens are inadequate in identifying EDCs that may affect pubertal maturation, not least because they do not consider 
 early-life exposure. Also, the causal relationship between EDC exposure and pubertal timing is still a matter of debate. To address this issue,
 we have used current knowledge to elaborate a network of putative adverse outcome pathways (pAOPs) to identify how chemicals can affect pubertal 
 onset. By using the AOP framework, we highlight current gaps in mechanistic understanding that need to be addressed and simultaneously point 
 towards events causative of pubertal disturbance that could be exploited for alternative test methods. We propose 6 pAOPs that could explain 
 the disruption of pubertal timing by interfering with the central hypothalamic trigger of puberty, GnRH neurons, and by so doing highlight 
 specific modes of action that could be targeted for alternative test method development. </p>
